# Signboard-Reader

Abstract - In this paper, a camera based real time signboard reading system has been proposed, in order to assist the visually impaired people. The system is a portable backpack, which consists of a monocular camera, mounted on a spectacle and earphones for providing audio feedback. The aim of the project is to develop a prototype which will aid the visually impaired to read signs and help them in their day-to-day life.
